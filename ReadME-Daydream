thomas.mccauley@cern.ch

* Use Unity 5.6 beta

* Needs Android SDK and Google VR SDK

* Built for Android 7.1

* Need to update SteamVR plugin

* Need to connect test phone with USB and need to turn USB debugging on

* Need to download Android SK command line tools and replace /tools in SDK from above with /tools
from command line tools (android command is deprecated in SDK and build error results otherwise)
